        <p>Welcome to my corner of the web! I'm Eric Trichel, a self-taught amateur web developer with a passion for technology and a knack for problem-solving.</p>
        
        <p>My journey into the world of IT began in an unconventional manner. After serving in the US Marine Corps for 8 years and gaining invaluable leadership and communication skills, I transitioned to the construction industry. However, my thirst for knowledge and a desire to challenge myself led me to explore the realm of web development.</p>
        
        <p>Through countless hours of self-study, fueled by YouTube videos, online courses, and hands-on experimentation, I honed my skills in IT Support, earning certifications from Google IT and Cisco Networking along the way. My transition from construction to technology was marked by a relentless pursuit of growth and learning, a trait I carry with me every day.</p>
        
        <p>While my professional journey has taken me from the military to construction and now to the exciting realm of IoT as a Field Service Technician with Toshiba, my passion for technology remains constant. I'm eagerly preparing to embark on the adventure of building my own mobile app, fueled by the same determination and curiosity that has propelled me thus far.</p>
        
        <p>My core soft skills of leadership, communication, and problem-solving have been instrumental in navigating various challenges throughout my career. Every hour spent working on personal projects adds to my arsenal of technical skills, reinforcing my belief in the power of continuous learning and improvement.</p>
        
        <p>I am committed to delivering outstanding results in everything I do, driven by a shared sense of pride with my clients. My ultimate aspiration is to evolve into a software engineer, leveraging my diverse background and skills to create innovative solutions that make a difference.</p>
        
        <p>Outside of work, you'll find me immersed in personal projects, whether it's designing websites, conceptualizing my next app, or tinkering with computer builds and upgrades. I thrive on the thrill of creation and the satisfaction of seeing my ideas come to life.</p>
        
        <p>Join me on this journey of exploration and growth, as I strive to push boundaries, defy expectations, and make meaningful contributions to the ever-evolving world of technology.</p>
